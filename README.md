# hapi

An API developer's best friend, or hopefully it will be.

## Purpose

Becaue leaving the CLI is in-efficient, and productivity is the only measure of people in this capitalist society I created this little CLI tool, to aid the development of API's. 

## Features

* Easily call API endpoints repeatedly. **(TODO)**
* Set-up multiple authentication methods, for switching between local and deployed environemnts. **(TODO)**
* Import API's from OpenAPI specifications. **(TODO)**
* Monitor changes in responses from API call to API call. **(TODO)**
* In the future ideally define integration tests, this can then run in any CI/CD pipeline.**(TODO)**
